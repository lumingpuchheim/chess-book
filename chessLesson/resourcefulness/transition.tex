\section{Resourcefulness in Chess}

Shackleton's story is not about victory. It is about what happens when everything goes wrong: the ship sinks, the plan fails, the future disappears. In those moments, resourcefulness becomes the difference between survival and surrender.

Chess offers the same test. Every player faces losing positions—material down, king exposed, pieces trapped, time running out. The natural response is resignation: accept defeat, stop fighting, give up. But resourcefulness means finding another way.

When material is lost, resourcefulness looks for activity. When the king is exposed, it finds counterplay. When pieces are trapped, it creates complications. When time is short, it simplifies to what matters most. The goal shifts from winning to surviving, from brilliance to persistence.

Shackleton did not cross Antarctica. He did not achieve his original dream. But he brought every man home. In chess, resourcefulness means the same: you may not win the game, but you can make your opponent work for it. You can create problems, find counterchances, turn a lost position into a difficult one, a difficult one into a draw, a draw into a win.

In section \ref{sec:lasker-steinitz-1894} we saw how Lasker prevented an immediate loss after he was down in material. Then he resourcefully created problems for Steinitz. The position was unclear and finally Steinitz lost a so-called ``winning game''.

We will present one more example.
