Life is like a game of chess, full of emotional highs and lows. Few moments capture this better than a world championship match, where pressure is immense-victory brings glory, while defeat can lead to silence and obscurity.

In Game 12 of the 2024 World Chess Championship, reigning champion Ding Liren was one point behind, standing at the edge of loss. His challenger needed only a draw- one of the hardest situations to overturn. Yet Ding played with clarity and calm, offering his opponent no real chances. The game became legend.

Afterward, the world asked how he prepared for such a performance under pressure. Ding smiled and said, ``it's simple. I changed my haircut alittle. I drank coffee.''

Simplicity, in a moment where the world expected depth, complexity or secret preparation. Ding reminded us: power doesn't always come from doing more, but from doing less-well. In life, as in chess, we often overthink. But clarity, presence and small shifts in mindset can carry us through.
