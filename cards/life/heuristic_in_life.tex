Here are three vivid examples where gut feeling acts like a heuristic in life:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Emergency Decision}

	You smell smoke and see a small flame. You don't calculate every possible exit route or estimate fire spread precisely. Your gut tells you ``Get out now!''. Heuristic: Recognize danger patterns from past experience or instinct-act quickly without full analysis.
	\item{Business Choice}

	You meet a potential business partner. Something about their tone, confidence or past behavior signals dishonesty. You decide to reject even without checking every reference. Heuristic: pattern recognition from prior interactions guides a rejection efficiently.
	\item{Medical Intuition}

	A seasoned doctor sees a patient with subtle signs of illness. Even if lab results are pending, they have a gut feeling about the diagnosis and start treatment. Heuristic: Experience forms chunks and mental shortcuts that guide immediate action.


\end{itemize}
