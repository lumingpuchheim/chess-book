Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, when asked to define the secret to their success in a single word, both independently answered: ``Focus.'' Both men have maintained unwavering focus on their core businesses throughout their careers. Buffett's business is value investing—identifying companies with strong earning potential and holding them for the long term. Gates's business is software development—building and dominating the technology industry through Microsoft.

For chess players, focus means only the current move—not the outcome, not fame or money, not potential criticism from commentators. Commentators judge based on results: take too much risk and lose, they call it unwise; play too conservatively and lose, they call it weak. Thinking about these distractions makes the next move worse and gives the opponent an advantage.

The only right thing to do is make the next move. Sometimes the result will be bad; next time will be better.
