Meditation and chess share the same mental discipline - the art of being fully present. In meditation, the goal is to center the mind on the current moment- not to dwell on past mistakes, nor to fear what is yet to come. In chess, this presence becomes a weapon. Every move demands complete awareness: calculation, intuition, and calm under pressure. A player who clings to a lost opportunity or worries about the next ten moves loses clarity - just as a distracted miditator loses balance. Both practices train the same muscle: the ability to return to now, again and again. Through meditation, the chess player sharpens focus, steadies emotions and finds stillness in chaos - the same stillness from which the best moves arises.
