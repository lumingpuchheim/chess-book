Stress rarely lives in the present moment. It comes from worrying about what might happen and regretting what already has. The mind prejects itself forward, imagining losses, failures or unfinished duties - or it driftsbackward, replaying mistakes and missed chances. In both directions, it fights against what cannot be chontrolled. When attention leaves the present, tension arises: muscles tighten, breathing shortens, thoughts loop. The body reacts as if danger were real, even when it exists only in imagination.

Peace returns the moment awareness anchors in now. The present contains effort but not anxiety, action but not regret. Letting go of past and future isn't passivity - it's clarity: doing what can be done here and now, and releasing everything else.
