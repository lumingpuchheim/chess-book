Planning an entire life in advance makes little sense. Life, like chess, is shaped by constant surprises and resistance. Long-term blueprints quickly become obsolete.

A more practical approach is to live objective by objective. Focus on small, concrete improvements: better food, better sleep, better habits. Like improving piece placement in chess, these modest adjustments require less energy and create flexibility.

Well-placed pieces don't win immediately, but they increase your options and make good outcomes more likely. In life, small improvements compound the same way. You don't need a grand plan—just a slightly better position than yesterday.
