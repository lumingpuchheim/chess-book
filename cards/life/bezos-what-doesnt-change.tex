Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has always asked a fundamental question: what doesn't change? While others focus on trends, technologies, and shifting markets, Bezos built his strategy around constants. The answer he found was simple: customers always want lower prices, faster delivery, and more choices. These desires are timeless—they were true when Amazon started, and they remain true today.

This insight became the foundation of Amazon's entire business model. Instead of chasing the latest trend or trying to predict which technology would dominate, Bezos focused on serving these unchanging customer needs. Every decision, every investment, every innovation was measured against this question: does this help us deliver lower prices, faster service, or more selection? By building on what doesn't change, Amazon created a business that could adapt to any new technology or market shift, because the core value proposition remained constant.

The power of this approach is that it provides a stable foundation in a world of constant change. When you know what doesn't change, you can invest confidently in improving those areas, knowing your efforts will compound over time rather than becoming obsolete. You can ignore the noise of temporary trends and focus your energy on what truly matters.
