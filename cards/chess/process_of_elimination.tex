\section{Process of Elimination}
\vocab{PoE}{Process of Elimination}{Ruling out bad moves, not immediately finding the perfect one. Commonly used in calculation, defense, and endgames}
 is the method instead of searching for a brilliant move directly, 
you narrow the field\cite{Dvoretsky:2015}.

How it works in practice:

\begin{itemize}
\item List candidate moves that are natural or forcing.
\item Eliminate bad moves by concrete reasons.
\item Compare the remaining moves and choose the one that best fits the position.
\end{itemize}
