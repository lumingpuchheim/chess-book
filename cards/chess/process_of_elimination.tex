\vocab{PoE}{}{
Ruling out bad moves, not immediately finding the perfect one. Commonly used in calculation, defense, and endgames.
}
Sometimes accurately calculating the consequences of our intended move is 
difficult and even unnecessary. It is easier to convince ourselves that it 
makes sense, is not refuted immediately, and all the other moves are bad or 
at least noticeably weaker. As a result, we save time and simultaneously 
confirm the correctness of our choice. It is natural to call this approach 
to decision-making the process of elimination \index{Process of Elimination} \cite{Dvoretsky:2015}.
