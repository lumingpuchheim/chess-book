\section{Process of Elimination}
\vocab{PoE}{Process of Elimination}{Ruling out bad moves, not immediately finding the perfect one. Commonly used in calculation, defense, and endgames}%
  is a thinking method for finding the best move by systematically ruling out inferior or impossible candidate moves, until only the strongest options remain.

Instead of searching for a brilliant move directly, you narrow the field.

How it works in practice:

\begin{itemize}
\item List candidate moves that are natural or forcing.

\item Eliminate bad moves by concrete reasons.

\item Compare the remaining moves and choose the one that best fits the position.
