    This exchange sacrifice was premature. White had not fully developed. His attack idea 
    was too simple: queen on h5 and knight on g5. Black should have been able to defend easily.

    \mainline[level=1]{8...c5}
    
    Black had a very simple idea to defend: \variation[invar]{8... f5} then \variation[invar]{9... Qe8}.
    After the queens were exchanged, Black could enjoy his material advantage.

    \mainline[level=1]{9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Ng5 h6 11. Nf3}

    \mainline{11... Nb4??}
    
    This was a blunder. With material down, White would not have cared if he lost more. His 
    only goal was to mate. 

    Black could still have exchanged the queens.
    \variation{11... Qd7 12. d5 Nb4 13. Bxh6 Qg4 14. Qxg4 Bxg4 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 } would have 
    been better.
    \mainline[level=1]{12. Bxh6}
    
    \chessboard

    \mainline[level=1]{12... Nc2+??}
    
    Black had to play \variation[invar]{12... e5 13. dxe5 dxe5 14. Rc1 Bxh6 15. Qxh6 Qb6}. 
    His position was still defensible.

    \mainline[level=1]{13. Kd2 Nxd4 14. Bxg7 Nxf3+ 15. gxf3 Kxg7 16. Qg5+ Kh8}
    
    \chessboard

    \mainline[level=1]{17. Bd3 Bh3 18. Qh6+ Kg8 19. Rg1+ Bg4 20. Rxg4#}

    I admit the exchange sacrifice was dubious. Black had good chances to defend since White was not fully
    developed. In the end, White was lucky to win the game because he simply played natural moves.
