\section{Hedgehog Position}
The Hedgehog is a pawn formation usually adopted by Black that 
can arise from several openings. Black trades the pawn on c5 for White's pawn on d4, then places pawns on a6, b6, d6, and e6. 
These pawns form a row of ``spines'' behind which Black develops pieces. 
Typically, the bishops sit on b7 and e7, knights on d7 and f6, the queen on c7, 
and rooks on c8 and e8 (or c8 and d8). 

Although the position may appear cramped, it has great latent energy, which can be released if Black can play ...b5 or ...d5 at some point. The Hedgehog system has been a popular choice among chess players for its strategic depth and the ability to create counterplay.
