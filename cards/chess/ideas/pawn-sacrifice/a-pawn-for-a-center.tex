\section{Pawn Sacrifice: Center}

In the opening or middlegame, a good center usually means 
piece activity. It is therefore a good idea to sacrifice a pawn or two for a center.

    There is a fierce fight in the center around d4. An alternative is \variation[invar]{9... Qf6 \xskakcomment{ a natural idea.}

    ]

    Black has a solid but passive position. It is probably not to Nepo's taste.

    In the middlegame, it is often more about choosing moves and positions according to the 
    players' style than finding the objectively best move.

    White has a solid center and Black has a compact position. Continuing in this manner 
    would suit Ding better because Nepo, as a dynamic player, cannot sit and wait passively.

    \variation[invar]{13. c5 dxc5 14. e5 Qh6 15. Rad1 Bg4 16. Qb3} would be a good idea but not a good practical decision:

    \chessboard[
        setfen=r3r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n4q/2p1P3/3P1pb1/1QP2N2/P3BPPP/3RR1K1 b - - 4 16
    ]

    The position is sharp. White may have some advantage. However, the position 
    is open and Black has counterplay and open lines. What is the point of allowing
    a dynamic player tactical opportunities?

    Ding chooses a natural move, improving his position slowly and not allowing Nepo any counterplay.
    
    \mainline[level=1]{ 13. Bd3 Bg4 14. Nd2}

    \mainline[level=1]{14...Na5?}
    
    A very strange move. The knight on a5 has no future. \variation[invar]{14...Rad8} would be a natural move.

    \chessboard
    
    \mainline[level=1]{ 15. c5!} With his sacrifice White activates his pieces.
    \mainline[level=1]{ 15... dxc5 16. e5 Qh6 17. d5 Rad8 18. c4}
    
    \chessboard

    White has some advantage here. His center is strong and Black has 
    a passive knight on a5. 

    While the position may still be equal according to the computer, for human players White has a much easier position to play. He controls the center, while his opponent, as a dynamic player, can only sit and wait. At some point, his opponent would lose patience while defending and make mistakes, as happened in this game. 

    \mainline[level=1]{18... b6 19. h3 Bh5}

    \chessboard[
        pgfstyle=straightmove,
        linewidth=0.05em,
        markmove=f4-f3,
        markstyle=circle,
        linewidth=0.05em,
        markfields={e5},
    ]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Where are the weaknesses?
    
        The e5 pawn is the pivot of the position and must be protected.
        \item Which is the worst-placed piece?
       
        The rooks must be activated.
        \item What is my opponent's idea?
    
        He wants to play \symknight f3, creating some counterplay.
    \end{itemize}
    
    By answering the questions above, White can find the next few moves:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Move his bishop to e4 then f3 (if Black exchanges the bishop, White has a knight on f3, which further strengthens the e5 pawn).
        \item Move his queen to c3 to protect the e5 pawn.
        \item Double his rooks on the e-file to protect the e5 pawn.
    \end{itemize}

    Black, however, must play move by move.

    \mainline[level=1]{20. Be4 Re7 21. Qc3 Rde8 22. Bf3 Nb7 23. Re2} 
    
    As mentioned above, White has a clear plan and needs only to execute it, without thinking too much. 

    \chessboard

    Black makes a difficult decision here, allowing White to create a passed pawn but gaining 
    a good square on d6 for his knight.
    
    \mainline[level=1]{23... f6 24. e6 Nd6 25. Rae1} 
    
    \chessboard[
        setfen=4r1k1/p1p1r1pp/1p1nPp1q/2pP3b/2P2p2/2Q2B1P/P2NRPP1/4R1K1 b - - 2 25
    ]

    White has executed his plan and Black has defended well. How should Black defend next?

    I believe the question can be answered logically without calculating a lot.
    The main asset of White is the passed pawns, which have been blocked by the Black rooks.

    The rooks on the e-file are not doing much because there is no open file. The knights are 
    important pieces. The Black knight keeps an eye on e4 so that the rooks cannot attack the 
    f4 pawn. 
    
    At some point, White may play \symrook e4 to attack the f4 pawn and exchange the Black knight.

    Alternatively, White may play \symknight e4 to exchange the Black knight. In either case, e4 is 
    an important square and must be protected in advance. \variation[invar]{25... Bg6} is a good move.

    It is unclear how White can make progress here. In the actual game, Black chooses to defend
    actively and soon makes a severe mistake.
    
    \mainline[level=1]{25... Nf5?!} 
    
    \chessboard

    White's bishop cannot improve White's position, while Black's bishop can defend the important e4
    square. It is therefore logical to exchange the bishops and then occupy the e4 square with the rook.
    
    \mainline[level=1]{ 26. Bxh5 Qxh5 27. Re4 Qh6 }
    
    \chessboard
    
    \mainline{28. Qf3}

    Again, a very logical move, attacking the weak f4 pawn. Ding's moves 
    are natural, although not the perfect computer moves. By playing these moves,
    he sets problems for Nepo that cannot be solved using dynamic play---a 
    very practical choice!
    
    \chessboard

    After \variation[invar]{28... g5 29. g4 Nd6}, the position is still defensible for Black. 

    \mainline[level=1]{28...Nd4?? } 
    
    \chessboard

    I am not sure whether Nepo sees a trap that backfires because Ding has set a deeper one. After \variation[invar]{29. Qxf4 Qxf4 30. Rxf4 c6 31. Nf3 Nxf3 32. Rxf3 cxd5 33. cxd5 Rd8 34. Rd3 Rd6} 
    
    \chessboard[setfen=6k1/p3r1pp/1p1rPp2/2pP4/8/3R3P/P4PP1/4R1K1 w - - 3 35]

    White has no advantage.

    More plausibly, Nepo loses his patience in defense and wants to force a draw. 
    
    \chessboard

    \mainline[level=1]{29. Rxd4! } 
    
    Of course, the knight is much more valuable than the rook.
