\section{Pawn Sacrifice}
A pawn sacrifice occurs when a player deliberately places one of their pawns in a position where it can be captured by the opponent. This tactic is often employed to achieve greater control over the board, disrupt the opponent's strategy, or create opportunities for more significant gains later in the game.
