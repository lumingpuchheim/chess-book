\section{Mobile Center}
A mobile pawn center is a central pawn formation where one side has at least two connected central pawns (usually on d4 and e4) 
that are free to advance, and the opponent has at most one pawn in the center. 
This gives the side with the pawn chain potential to push those pawns forward 
to gain space or create passed pawns, and often forces the opponent to defend 
against advancing pawns rather than contesting the center directly.

    markmove={d4-d5, e4-e5},

The typical strategic plan for the side with the mobile center is to advance pawns and try to create a passed pawn 
or use pawn pressure to push pieces away. We will see both strategies in this section.
