\section{Queen's Gambit Declined}
The Queen's Gambit Declined is one of the most solid and principled answers to 1.d4. By refusing the gambit with …e6, Black prioritizes a stable pawn structure and long-term soundness over immediate material gain. This opening has been a cornerstone of classical chess and remains a mainstay at the highest level.

White's typical ideas focus on central control and piece activity. By supporting the d4-pawn and developing smoothly, White aims for lasting space advantage, pressure on the center, and harmonious coordination of pieces. Plans often include e3 or cxd5 followed by rapid development, placing rooks on central files, and using the slight spatial edge to build up kingside or queenside play.

Black, in turn, accepts a somewhat passive but resilient position. The main strategic task is to challenge White's center at the right moment, usually with …c5 or …e5, while completing development without weaknesses. Black often concedes space temporarily in exchange for a robust structure, clear defensive resources, and excellent endgame prospects.

Overall, the Queen's Gambit Declined leads to rich strategic battles where understanding plans and timing matters more than memorizing moves. It is an opening about patience, structure, and deep positional ideas for both sides.
