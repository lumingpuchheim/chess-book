Many pieces were exchanged, and Andersson deliberately headed for an endgame
where he could press with a persistent but risk-free advantage.

\chessboard

This was the position Andersson had in mind when he played his 14th move.
How should we evaluate this endgame? A good starting point is to examine
the pawn structure.

Black had two clear weaknesses: the pawns on a6 and h7.
As the game continued, White used his king to attack these pawns directly.
Also notice Black's doubled pawns on the f-file; they gave White enough time
to bring his king into Black's position.

A similar pawn endgame was played by Rubinstein in 1909. 
In that game, the defender had exactly the same pawn structure!
I am sure Andersson was aware of this endgame when he played the opening.
From that position, Rubinstein was winning. We will examine that endgame 
after this game. In Rubinstein's game, the attacking king marched to the kingside. 
After liquidating all the pawns there, the king dominated because it was closer 
to the queenside pawns.

White had no real weaknesses in his camp. He would place his pawns on light
squares so that Black's dark-squared bishop could not attack them.

Compared to that game, one key difference made Black's current position still 
defendable: his king was closer to the kingside weakness. We will see 
how Andersson lured the Black king away in the actual game.

We also had a knight versus bishop endgame (with the rooks). 
After the rooks were exchanged, White's pieces were actually too slow to attack
both weaknesses simultaneously, because the bishop could defend in time, so Black had decent practical chances to hold.
However, White could simply improve his position and wait for a mistake, so his
winning chances remained very good.

\chessboard

One of the most neglected principles in chess is \emph{don't rush}. 
Before pushing forward, White had to first prevent Black's rook from invading
on d2. His next move was highly instructive.

31. hxg4 Rc6 32. Rxc6 Kxc6 33. Nd3!}

\chessboard

White had to stop Black's king from invading. The d5 square was also
temporarily defended because after \variation[invar]{33...Kd5? 34. Nb4+}
Black would simply lose a pawn.

\mainline[level=1]{33...a5 34. e4!}

\chessboard 

Now d5 was also defended permanently. White was ready to march his king toward
Black's kingside while Black was reduced to waiting.

\chessboard

\mainline[level=1]{38. g5!}

White now sacrificed a pawn temporarily to open lines for a decisive king invasion. \index{Pawn Sacrifice!Infiltration}

\chessboard

The first mission was accomplished: White's king had infiltrated Black's camp.
Next he would march toward the queenside to attack the remaining weakness.

\mainline[level=1]{51...Bd4?}

Until this point Black had defended well. After the move in the game, however,
White placed him in zugzwang, won a pawn, and with it the game. Black should
have played \variation[invar]{51... Bg1}
\mainline[level=1]{52. b4 Kd7 53. Nc5+ Kd6 54. Kb6 Bc3 55. Kxb5 Bd2
