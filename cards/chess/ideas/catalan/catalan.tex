\section{Catalan Opening}
The Catalan Opening is a chess opening that begins with 1.d4 and 2.c4, followed by g3 and Bg2. It often arises via the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3, combining ideas from the Queen’s Gambit and the Réti.

The main idea of the Catalan is long-term positional pressure rather than immediate tactics. White fianchettoes the king’s bishop to g2, placing it on the long diagonal where it exerts strong pressure on the central squares d5 and e4, and later on the queenside. White usually allows tension in the center and does not rush to occupy it with pawns. \index{Endgame!Knight vs. Bishop}

A key theme is that Black may capture the pawn on c4. White often accepts this temporarily, using faster development and better piece activity to pressure Black until the pawn is recovered or Black is forced into concessions. This is known as the Open Catalan. If Black keeps the center closed and does not take on c4, the game becomes a Closed Catalan, where White slowly builds pressure against Black’s solid but somewhat passive structure.

Overall, the Catalan aims for stable central control, strong piece coordination, and a small but persistent advantage that often becomes clearer in the middlegame and endgame.
