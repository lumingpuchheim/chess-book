I don't like Black's position. White already has a static advantage
because his pawn formation is better and Black has a passive
light square bishop.

On the other hand, White has some natural moves to develop:
\symbishop c4, O-O, \symrook ad1, \symrook fe1 etc.

It is however difficult to recommend any dynamic play for Black here.

White is planning the d5 thrust to create a central passed pawn.
Black could also tried
\variation[invar]{14... Na5 15. Bf1 Rc8 16. d5 Nc4 17. Bxc4 Rxc4}
    \variation{18. d6 Rxe4 19. Ne5 Rxe1 20. Rxe1 Bd5\xskakcomment{Black can defend the ending}}

% 2025. 11.5: I wrote the following during my own analysis. 
% the conclusion is premature because I miss error on Black's next move
% "Now White has a straight forward move, his light square bishop can
% exchange an important defender, Black's light square bishop 
% while the Black's knight can't help too much in the defense."

% 2025. 11.5: In my analysis, I saw the knight stuck at a5 for a long time.
% I failed to point out, that 16... Na5 is an error.

\chessboard
% 2025. 11.5: I missed the error completely. Alas, it is a critical position and I failed to 
% see it. 
Black should have played \varriation[invar]{15... Na5}
\variation{16. dxe6 Nxc4? 17. exf7+ Kh8 18. Qxd8 Rcxd8 19. Rxd8 Rxd8 20. e5} White wins.
\variation{16. dxe6 Qxd2 17. exf7+ Kh8 18. Nxd2 Nxc4 19. Nxc4 Rxc4 20. e5 Bc8 21. e6 Bxe6 22. Rxe6} equal.
Petrosian didn't like \variation{16. Bd3 exd5 17. e5! Nc4 18. Qf4} White has an attack. Indeed, Polugaevsky won a brilliant game
against Tal later. Black must find the only defense \symrook c6.

\mainline{15... exd5 16. Bxd5
    Na5 17. Qf4} 


\chessboard

Black has a desperate position. He cannot defend the d5 passed pawn.
White could also play \symqueen f5, \symknight g5 attack the h7 pawn.
