        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Who has a static advantage?}

            White has static advantage because after normal play, he can simply play \symqueen xc3. 
            He can double his rooks on the d-file. If Black responds with d5, White can attack freely along 
            the g-file.
            \item{Which play shall I choose?}

            I must therefore choose a dynamic play. 
            \item{Whas is the move?}

            \symknight xe5.
        \end{itemize}

        Black has c3 pawn as an asset. White extends too much on the kingside and Black must exploit it. 

        After \variation[invar]{1...Nxe5 2.fxe5 Bxe5 3.bxc3 Rc8!}, Black has enough compensation.
