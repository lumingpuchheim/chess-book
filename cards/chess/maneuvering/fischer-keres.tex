White has no active plan so black can choose his own maneuver. White has weakness on c2. 
\symrook c8 is not possible since white's bishop controls c8. \symrook a5 is natural because the 
rook targets c5 aiming the weakness c2 in the next move.

Serendipitously, the move also aims h5. White must figure out how to defend. At 
the moment we don't need to concern how white will defend. Let's pass the ball to 
white and decide then what to do.
