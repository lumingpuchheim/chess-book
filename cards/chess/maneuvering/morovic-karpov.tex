		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Where are the weaknesses?}

			White has weakness on c4.
			\item{Which is the worst-placed piece?}

			The knight on e7 is inactive. 
			\item{Whas is my opponent's idea?}

			Not clear. He has difficulty to evolve his position.
		\end{itemize}

		White has weakness on c4. e7 knight is the worst piece. 
		So moving it aiming for c4 is a natural idea. \symknight c8 is the answer.
