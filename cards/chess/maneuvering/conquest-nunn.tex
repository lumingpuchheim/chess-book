	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Where are the weaknesses?}

		White king as well as his main diagonal is weak.
		\item{Which is the worst-placed piece?}

		The light-squared bishop does nothing.
		\item{What is my opponent's idea?}

		He can only wait passively.
	\end{itemize}

	By answering the template question above, the correct move is \symbishop d7, improving the piece as well as exploiting White's weakness on the main diagonal.
