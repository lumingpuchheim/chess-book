We use a simple graphical system to illustrate the three questions as used by Aagaard in his book ``Grandmaster Preparations Positional Play''. 

We will use circle to identify weakness. We will use square to identify the worst-placed pieces. We will use arrows to illustrate the opponent's ideas.


Let us look at an example
