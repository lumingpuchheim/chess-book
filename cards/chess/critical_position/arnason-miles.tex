        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Who has a static advantage?}

            Black enjoys a static advantage thanks to his healthy extra pawn.
            With best play he should be able to convert.
            \item{Which plan should I choose?}

            I therefore need to look for dynamic resources. 
            \item{What is the move?}

            \symrook xg5!
        \end{itemize}

        \mainline{
        36. Rxg5+ Kxg5 37. Qd2+ Kg6 38. Qg2+ Kf7 39. Bd5 Qxd5 40. exd5 Rg8 41. Qxg8+ Kxg8 }

        \chessboard

        The resulting position is no worse than the initial one.
        White remains a pawn down, but his protected passed pawn grants him counterplay.
        Black still has to demonstrate a concrete route to victory.
