Dorfman suggests three criteria for the existence of a critical position\cite{Dorfman:2001} \index{Critical Position}. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{A position in which a decision has to be taken regarding a possible exchange. If the 
exchange is forced, there is no change compared with the previous critical position. }
    \item{A position in which a decision has to be taken regarding a possible change in the 
pawn formation. Especially of the central pawns. }
    \item{The end of a series of forced moves. Here one should not draw a parallel between 
forced moves and the moves relating to a combination. }
\end{enumerate}
To sense that a position is critical is already a great success.
