\section{Mined Squares}
Sometimes, it is a single pair of squares that correspond.
Do not be the first to step on a mined square, or you will be ``blown up'',
falling into zugzwang. You must either first allow your opponent to step 
on the mined square, or move forward, accurately avoiding it.

\vocab{mined-square}{Mined Square}{A square that is dangerous to step on, because it will cause the stepping player to be blown up, falling into zugzwang.}
