\section{Drawn Positions: Bishop and Pawn}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    If the bishop does not control the rook pawn's 
    queening square, then the weaker side has 
    only to get his king in to corner (``safe corner''). 

    \begin{chessdiagram}[Safe Corner]
        \chessboard[
            setfen=6k1/8/6BP/8/8/8/2K5/8 b - - 0 1,
            showmover=false,
        ]
        \label{chess:bishop-endgame-1}
    \end{chessdiagram}

    The draw is obvious since White cannot drive the Black king 
    away from the corner.
    
    \begin{chessdiagram}[Pawns at h6 and h7]
        \chessboard[
            setfen=6k1/7p/4K2P/4B3/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1,
            showmover=false,
        ]
        \label{chess:bishop-endgame-2}
    \end{chessdiagram}

    The position is a draw because Black's king only needs to move 
    between f8 and g8 and White cannot attack the h7 pawn. The evaluation 
    would not change if you added pawn pairs at g5/g6 and f4/f5.

    \begin{chessdiagram}[Pawns at h7 and Pawn at g6 (Ponziani)]
        \chessboard[
            setfen=8/6kB/6P1/5K2/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1,
            showmover=false,
        ]
        \label{chess:bishop-endgame-3}
    \end{chessdiagram}
    
    This drawing position has been known since the 18th century. The 
    bishop cannot escape from its corner and giving it up leads to a 
    drawn pawn ending.
