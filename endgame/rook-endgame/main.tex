\chapter{Rook Endgames}
Rook endgames are the most intimidating and most important endgames.
Most intimidating because there is quite a lot of knowledge one 
must remember. Most important because they occur in practice 
much more often than the others. A rook endgame may also transpose 
to other endgames. Here is a non-exhaustive list. Knowledge about other endgames 
is therefore also necessary.

\begin{itemize}
    \item rook and pawn endgame
    \item rook vs. knight endgame
    \item pawn endgame
    \item queen vs. rook endgame
    \item queen and rook middlegame/endgame
\end{itemize}

This chapter starts from the basics and gradually adds more complexity. At 
the end, we will showcase some practical examples.
