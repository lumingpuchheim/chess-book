\section{King Activity}

King actiity is the most important factor in the evaluation of position in a pawn
endgame. In fact, not just in pawn endgames, in any endgame. But in pawn endgame,
where there are no other pieces on the board, this is perhaps an especially important factor.

Chess is a tragedy of one tempo. White would draw if he could play \symking g2 now, 
but he lacks that crucial move! \index{Pawn Endgame!King Activity}
