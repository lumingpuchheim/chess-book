Chess masters use \vocab{PoE}{Process of Elimination}{Ruling out bad moves, not immediately finding the perfect one. Commonly used in calculation, defense, and endgames} to find the best move.
How it works in practice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item List candidate moves that are natural or forcing.
  \item Eliminate bad moves by concrete reasons.
  \item Compare the remaining moves and choose the one that best fits the position.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Charlie Munger: Avoiding Stupidity}
\input{../cards/life/munger-process-of-elimination}

Both Watzlawick and Munger use the Process of Elimination to make better decisions.
One open question is, what is the criteria for the bad moves? 
Munger has listed some very practical criteria:  businesses
with dishonest management, fragile balance sheets, or economics he cannot understand.

\section*{Invest by Elimination}
Charlie Munger has analyzed the history of failures and developed his own list of criteria to avoid.
His list is certainly useful for him. I believe I need to develop my own list because 
I have access to the internet, which he did not use often, and I come from a different background than he did. 
In this book, I will list the criteria that help identify investments to avoid. 
Different companies exhibit different symptoms, and therefore the list will never be complete. 
As the Germans say, ``the way is the goal.'' So let's get started.
