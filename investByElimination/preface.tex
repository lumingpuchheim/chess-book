Chess masters use \vocab{PoE}{Process of Elimination}{Ruling out bad moves, not immediately finding the perfect one. Commonly used in calculation, defense, and endgames} to find the best move.
How it works in practice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item List candidate moves that are natural or forcing.
  \item Eliminate bad moves by concrete reasons.
  \item Compare the remaining moves and choose the one that best fits the position.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Charlie Munger: Avoiding Stupidity}
\input{../cards/life/munger-process-of-elimination}

Both Watzlawick and Munger use the Process of Elimination to make better decisions.
One open question is, what is the criteria for the bad moves? 
Munger has listed some very practical criteria:  businesses
with dishonest management, fragile balance sheets, or economics he cannot understand.

\section*{Invest by Elimination}
In this book, I will add more criteria that help identify investments to avoid. 
In this era, the internet is full of information—or rather noise—that is overwhelming. 
I will add some other symptoms to the stop list: press releases with empty content, 
focusing on scores only, internal bureaucracy. I will also explain why dishonest 
management is dangerous using my own experiences at a company.
